# CarSearch App

A basic project where users can be search cars for rent, filtering per brand, model, fuel and year.

In this repository you will find two versions of this same project, the first one is a server-side render project and the second one (located in the client-side branch) is being rendered, as its name says, on the client-side. This because of a Next.js 13 bug on the search methods.

## API's

For images and car information (not real data) I'm consuming two API's.

### Cars by API-Ninjas

This API provided all the information from every car that users search for, so they can have a complete tech sheet of each car.

### Car Imagery by Imagin.Studio

API than allows the application to show accurate images of the cars.
